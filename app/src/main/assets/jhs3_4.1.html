<h2>4. Summarizing Data&nbsp;</h2>
<p>If the data set is very large, it is useful to be able to summarize the data set by calculating a few quantities that give information about how the data values are spread and about the central values in the data set.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4.1 Measures of Central Tendency&nbsp;</h3>
<p>An average is simply a number that is representative of a set of data. Specifically, it is a measure of central tendency which means that it gives an indication of the main tendency of the set of data. Averages are useful for comparing data, especially when sets of different sizes are being compared. There are several types of average. Perhaps the simplest and most commonly used average is the mean of a set of data. Other common types of average are the median and the mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mean&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The mean, (also known as arithmetic mean), is simply the arithmetic average of a group of numbers (or data set) and is shown using the bar symbol&macr;. So, the mean of the variable x is x&macr; pronounced&rdquo; x-bar&rdquo;. The mean of a set of values is calculated by adding up all the values in the set and dividing by the number of items in that set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Definition: Mean The mean of a data set,&nbsp;, denoted by&nbsp;, is the average of the data values, and is calculated as:&nbsp;&nbsp;x = = (sum of all values)/(number of values)</p>
<p>Method: Calculating the mean&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Find the total of the data values in the data set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Count how many data values there are in the data set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Divide the total by the number of data values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worked Example 64:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mean Question: What is the mean of x = {10,20,30,40,50}?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Find the total of the data values 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Count the number of data values in the data set There are 5 values in the data set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Divide the total by the number of data values. 150 &divide; 5 = 30&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: Answer&nbsp;&there4;&nbsp;the mean of the data set x = {10,20,30,40,50} is 30.</p>
<p>Median&nbsp;</p>
<p>Definition: Median The median of a set of data is the data value in the central position, when the data set has been arranged from highest to lowest or from lowest to highest. There are an equal number of data values on either side of the median value.</p>
<p>The median is calculated from the raw, ungrouped data, as follows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calculating the median&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Order the data from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Count how many data values there are in the data set.</p>
<p>3. Find the data value in the central position of the set.</p>
<p>Worked Example 65:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Median Question:&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the median of {10,14,86,2,68,99,1}?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Order the data set from lowest to highest 1,2,10,14,68,85,99&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Count the number of data values in the data set There are 7 points in the data set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Find the central position of the data set the central position of the data set is 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: Find the data value in the central position of the ordered data set. 14 is in the central position of the data set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5: Answer&nbsp;&there4;&nbsp;14 is the median of the data set {1,2,10,14,68,85,99}.</p>
<p>This example has highlighted a potential problem with determining the median. It is very easy to determine the median of a data set with an odd number of data values, but what happens when there is an even number of data values in the data set? When there is an even number of data values, the median is the mean of the two middle points.</p>
<p>Important: Finding the Central Position of a Data Set</p>
<p>&nbsp;An easy way to determine the central position or positions for any ordered data set is to take the total number of data values, add 1, and then divide by 2. If the number you get is a whole number, then that is the central position. If the number you get is a fraction, take the two whole numbers on either side of the fraction, as the positions of the data values that must be averaged to obtain the median.</p>
<p>Worked Example 66:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Median Question:&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the median of {11,10,14,86,2,68,99,1}?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1 : Order the data set from lowest to highest 1,2,10,11,14,68,85,99&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2 : Count the number of data values in the data set There are 8 points in the data set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3 : Find the central position of the data set The central position of the data set is between positions 4 and 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4 : Find the data values around the central position of the ordered data set. 11 is in position 4 and 14 is in position 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5 : Answer&nbsp;&there4;&nbsp;the median of the data set {1,2,10,11,14,68,85,99} is (11 + 14) &divide; 2 = 12,5</p>
<p>Mode&nbsp;</p>
<p>Definition: Mode The mode is the data value that occurs most often, i.e. it is the most frequent value or most common value in a set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method: Calculating the mode Count how many times each data value occurs. The mode is the data value that occurs the most. The mode is calculated from grouped data, or single data items.</p>
