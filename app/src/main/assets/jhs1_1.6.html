<h3>1.6 Types of Real Numbers&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>1.2.1 Integers&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The natural numbers are all the numbers which you can use for counting&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">0, 1, 2, 3, 4 . . .</p>
<p>These are the first numbers learnt by children, and the easiest to understand. Mathematicians use the symbol N to mean the set of all-natural numbers. The natural numbers are a subset of the real numbers since every natural number is also a real number. The integers are all of the natural numbers and their negatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&minus; 4, &minus;3, &minus;2, &minus;1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 . . .</p>
<p>Mathematicians use the symbol Z to mean the set of all integers. The integers are a subset of the real numbers, since every integer is a real number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A fraction is any kind of number divided by another number. There are several ways to write a number divided by another one, such as</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>a &divide; b, a/b and a b.</em></p>
<p>The first way of writing a fraction is very hard to work with, so we will use only the other two. We call the number on the top, the numerator and the number on the bottom the denominator. e.g.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reciprocal of a fraction is the fraction turned upside down, in other words the numerator becomes the denominator and the denominator becomes the numerator. A fraction times its reciprocal always equals 1 and can be written a b &times; b a = 1 This is because dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. A decimal number is a number which has an integer part and a fraction part. The integer and the fraction parts are separated by a decimal point, which is written as a comma in South Africa. Every real number can be written as a decimal. For example, the number 3+14/100 can be written much more cleanly as 3,14. All real numbers can be written as a decimal. However, some numbers would take a huge amount of paper (and ink) to write out in full! Some decimal numbers will have a number which will repeat itself, such as 0,33333 . . . where there are an infinite number of 3&rsquo;s. We can write this decimal value by using a dot above the repeating number, so 0,3˙ = 0,33333 . . .. If there are two repeating numbers such as 0,121212 . . . then you can place dots6 on each of the repeated numbers 0,1˙2˙ = 0,121212 . . .. These kinds of repeating decimals are called recurring decimals.</p>
