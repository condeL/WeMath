<h3>3.1 Polygons&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A polygon is a shape or figure with many straight sides. A polygon has interior angles. These are the angles that are inside the polygon. The number of sides of a polygon equals the number of interior angles. If a polygon has equal length sides and equal interior angles then the polygon is called a regular polygon. We denote a line segment that extends between a point A and some point B by line AB. The length of this line is just AB. So, if we say, AB = CD we mean that the length of the line segment from A to B is equal to the length of the line segment from C to D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;is the line segment with length AB and direction from point A to point B. Similarly,&nbsp;&nbsp;is the line segment with length AB = BA and direction from point B to point A. Suppose we have two-line segments AB and BC that join at a point B. We denote the angle B between the line segments by&nbsp;. A line of symmetry divides a shape in such a way that it appears the same on both sides of the line. For example, if you divide a square along its one diagonal then you divide it into two triangles that are exactly the same i.e., they fit perfectly on each other when the square is folded along the diagonal. If a line AB bisects a line CD then AB divides CD into half. A stop sign is in the shape of an octagon, an eight-sided polygon. Some coins are heptagonal and hexagonal. In the UK there are two heptagonal coins. The honeycomb of a beehive consists of hexagonal cells.</p>
<h4>Triangles&nbsp;</h4>
<p>A triangle is a three-sided polygon. The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180◦. The exterior angle of any corner of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two-opposite interior. We have the following triangles:</p>
<strong>Equilateral</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All 3 sides are equal and each angle is 60◦.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Isosceles</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two equal angles occur opposite two equal sides and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right-angled</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This triangle has a right angle. The side opposite this angle is called the hypotenuse. Pythagoras&rsquo;s Theorem is often applied to this type of triangle&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scalene</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is any other triangle where the sides have different lengths and angles are different sizes.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Quadrilaterals</h4>
<p>Quadrilaterals are four-sided polygons. The basic quadrilaterals are the trapezium, parallelogram, rectangle, rhombus, square and kite.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trapezium&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This quadrilateral has one pair of parallel opposite sides. It may also be called a trapezoid. If the other pair of opposite sides is also parallel then the trapezium is a parallelogram. Another type of trapezium is the isosceles trapezium, where one pair of opposite sides is parallel, the other pair of sides is equal and the angles at the ends of each parallel side are equal. An isosceles trapezium has one line of symmetry and its diagonals are equal in length.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parallelogram&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A parallelogram is a special type of trapezium. It is a quadrilateral with two pairs of opposite sides equal. Squares, rectangles and rhombuses are parallelograms. We have the following properties of parallelograms. Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Both pairs of opposite sides are equal in length. Both pairs of opposite angles are equal. Both diagonals bisect each other (i.e. they cut each other in half). There are not always lines of symmetry.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rectangle&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is a parallelogram with 90◦ angles. Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Both pairs of opposite sides are equal. All angles are equal to 90◦. Both diagonals bisect each other. Diagonals are equal in length. There are two lines of symmetry.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rhombus&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is a parallelogram with adjacent sides equal. Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. All sides are equal in length. Both pairs of opposite angles equal. Both diagonals bisect each other at 90◦ . Diagonals of a rhombus bisect both pairs of opposite angles. There are two lines of symmetry.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Square&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is a rhombus with all four angles equal to 90◦ or a rectangle with adjacent sides equal. 78 In a square both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. All sides are equal in length. All angles are equal to 90◦ . Both diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Diagonals are equal in length and bisect both pairs of opposite angles. There are four lines of symmetry.</p>
<p><strong>Kite&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A kite is a parallelogram with two pairs of adjacent sides equal. Other properties of a kite are that the two pairs of adjacent sides are equal. One pair of opposite angles are equal where the angles must be between unequal sides. One diagonal bisects the other diagonal and one diagonal bisects one pair of opposite angles. Diagonals intersect at right-angles. There is one line of symmetry.</p>
