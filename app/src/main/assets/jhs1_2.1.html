<h2>2.0 Sets</h2>
<h3>2.1 Definition&nbsp;</h3>
<p>If you want to prepare a cake, you need flour, eggs, margarine, baking powder and sugar. When you buy these ingredients in a shop, you probably do not buy them one at a time. It is easier and cheaper to buy them in a set. We often use the word &lsquo;<strong><em>set</em></strong>&rsquo; to describe a collection of objects, quantities or numbers. We have a set of living room furniture: what does it contain? We speak of cutlery set, a math set, the set of students under 14 in your class and so on. Can you think of anymore?</p>
<p><strong><em>A set is a well-defined collection of objects, quantities or numbers that have a given property or properties in common.</em></strong></p>

<p>A set is usually denoted by capital letters such as <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>P</em>, <em>Q</em>, <em>X&nbsp;</em>and <em>Y</em>. The objects that make up a set are called <strong><em>members&nbsp;</em></strong>or <strong><em>elements&nbsp;</em></strong>of the set. The elements of a set may be named in a list or may be given by a description enclosed in braces {}. For instance, the set of numbers between 1 and 6 may be given as {2, 3, 4, 5} or as {the numbers between 1 and 6}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, in the set <em>Q&nbsp;</em>= {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}, 4 is a member or element of the set <em>Q</em>. In set operations, the symbol is used to denote the clause <strong>&lsquo;<em>is a member of</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>&lsquo;<em>is an element of</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong>or &lsquo;<strong><em>belongs to</em></strong>&rsquo;. So, the statement &lsquo;4 is a member of <em>Q</em>&rsquo; can be written as 4  <em>Q</em>. Can you name the other elements of the set <em>Q</em>? Similarly the statement &lsquo;<strong><em>5 is not a member of Q</em></strong>&rsquo; may abbreviated to ,  standing for &lsquo;<strong><em>is not an element of</em></strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong><em>does not belong to</em></strong>&rsquo;. The number of elements in set <em>Q&nbsp;</em>is 6 and this is denoted as <em>n</em>(<em>Q</em>) = 6.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 2.1&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If <em>A&nbsp;</em>= {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and <em>B&nbsp;</em>= {3, 5, 7, 9}, complete the following statements by inserting&nbsp;,&nbsp;, <em>A</em>, <em>B&nbsp;</em>or elements of the sets <em>A&nbsp;</em>and <em>B&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>(a) 4 &hellip; <em>A&nbsp;</em>(b) 6 &hellip; (c) 2 &hellip; (d) 8 &hellip; <em>B&nbsp;</em>(e) &hellip; <em>A&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>(f) 10 &hellip; <em>B&nbsp;</em>(g) 5 &hellip; (h) 7 &hellip; (i) 7 &hellip; <em>B&nbsp;</em>(j) &hellip; <em>B</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>(a) 4 <em>A</em>, </p>
<p>(b) 6 <em>A</em>, </p>
<p>(c) 2 <em>B</em>, </p>
<p>(d) 8 <em>B</em>, </p>
<p>(e) 9 <em>A</em>,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(f) 10 <em>B</em>,</p>
<p>(g) 5<em>B</em>, </p>
<p>(h) 7 <em>A</em>, </p>
<p>(i) 7 <em>B</em>, </p>
<p>(j) 2&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>B</em>. </p>
