<h3>2.4 Using Differentiation with Graphs&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In section we saw that finding the tangent to a function is the same as finding its slope at a particular point. The slope of a function at a point is just its derivative. If we want to find a general formula for a tangent to a function, we differentiate the function. To find the slope of the tangent at a particular point, we substitute that point&rsquo;s x value into the function&rsquo;s derivative. This will give us a single value, which is the slope of a straight line.</p>
