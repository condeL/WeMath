<h3>1.1 Addition, subtraction and multiplication of surds&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>Simplifying surds&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Consider the square root of the number 6. We know that 2 &times; 3 is 6 and so &radic;6 can be written as &radic;(2&times;3). Therefore, the square root of 6 can be expressed as the product of the square roots of 2 and 3. That is &radic;(6 ) = &radic;2 &times; &radic;3. Similarly, &radic;12 = &radic;(4 &times;3) = &radic;4 &times; &radic;3 = 2&radic;3. In general, If k = mn, then &radic;k &radic;mn = &radic;m &radic;n.</p>
<p>If &radic;n is such that n can be expressed as the product of a perfect square and another integer, then &radic;n is said to be a reducible surd. For example, since 12 can be expressed as a product of the perfect square 4 and the number 3, &radic;12 is a reducible surd.</p>
<p>Example 2.1 Simplify the following&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) &radic;20,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) &radic;18,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) &radic;32,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) &radic;63.</p>
<p>Solution&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) &radic;20 = &radic;(4 &times;5) = &radic;4 &times; &radic;5= 2&radic;5,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) &radic;18 = &radic;(9 &times;2) = &radic;9 * &radic;2 = 3 &radic;2,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) &radic;32 = &radic;(16 &times;2) = &radic;16 * &radic;2 = 4 &radic;2,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) &radic;63 = &radic;(9 &times;7) = &radic;9 * &radic;7 = 3 &radic;7.</p>
