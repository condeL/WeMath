<p>1.1.1 Simplifying surds&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the square root of the number 6. We know that 2 × 3 is 6 and so √6 can be written as √(2×3). Therefore, the square root of 6 can be expressed as the product of the square roots of 2 and 3. That is √(6 ) = √2 × √3. Similarly, √12 &nbsp;= √(4 ×3) = √4 × √3 = 2√3. In general, If k = mn, then √k √mn = √m √n.</p>
<p>If √n is such that n can be expressed as the product of a perfect square and another integer, then √n is said to be a reducible surd. For example, since 12 can be expressed as a product of the perfect square 4 and the number 3, √12 is a reducible surd.</p>
<p>Example 2.1 Simplify the following&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) √20,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) √45,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) √18,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) √32,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e) √63.</p>
<p>Solution&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) √20 = &nbsp;√(4 ×5) = √4 × √5= 2√5,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) √45 &nbsp;= √9*5 &nbsp;= √(9 ) * &nbsp;√5 = 3 √5,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) √18 = √(9 ×2) = √9 * √2 = 3 √2,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) √32 = √(16 ×2) = √16 * √2 = 4 √2,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e) √63 = √(9 ×7) = √9 * √7 = 3 √7.</p>
