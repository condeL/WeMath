<h3>1.2 Definition of Logarithms</h3>
<p>The logarithm of a number is the index to which the base must be raised to give that number. From the first example of the activity log<sub>2</sub> (4) (read log to the base 2 of 4) means the power of 2 that will give 4. Therefore,</p>
<p>log<sub>2</sub> (4) = 2</p>
<h4>Logarithm Bases</h4>
<p>Logarithms, like exponentials, also have a base and log2 (2) is not the same as log10(2). We generally use the &ldquo;common&rdquo; base, 10, or the natural base, e. The number e is an irrational number between 2.71 and 2.72. It comes up surprisingly often in Mathematics, but for now suffice it to say that it is one of the two common bases.</p>
<p><em>Extension: Natural Logarithm The natural logarithm (symbol ln) is widely used in the sciences. The natural logarithm is to the base e which is approximately 2.71828183.... e is like &pi; and is another example of an irrational number.</em></p>
<p>While the notation log<sub>10</sub>(x) and log<sub>e</sub> (x) may be used, log<sub>10</sub>(x) is often written log(x) in Science and loge (x) is normally written as ln(x) in both Science and Mathematics.</p>
<p>So, if you see the log symbol without a base, it means log<sub>10</sub>. It is often necessary or convenient to convert a log from one base to another. An engineer might need an approximate solution to a log in a base for which he does not have a table or calculator function, or it may be algebraically convenient to have two logs in the same base.</p>
<p>Logarithms can be changed from one base to another, by using the change of base formula:</p>
<p>loga x = (logb x)/(logb a)</p>
<p>where b is any base you find convenient. Normally a and b are known, therefore is normally a known, if irrational, number. For example, change log<sub>2</sub> 12 in base 10 is:</p>
<p>log<sub>2</sub> 12 = (log<sub>10</sub> 12 )/(log<sub>10</sub> 2)</p>
