<h3>4.2 Measures of Dispersion&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The mean, median and mode are measures of central tendency, i.e. they provide information on the central data values in a set. When describing data, it is sometimes useful (and in some cases necessary) to determine the spread of a distribution. Measures of dispersion provide information on how the data values in a set are distributed around the mean value. Some measures of dispersion are range, percentiles and quartiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Range&nbsp;</p>
<p>Definition: Range The range of a data set is the difference between the lowest value and the highest value in the set.</p>
<p>Method:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calculating the range 1. Find the highest value in the data set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Find the lowest value in the data set.</p>
<p>3. Subtract the lowest value from the highest value. The difference is the range.</p>
<p>Worked Example 68:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Range Question: Find the range of the data set x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9,10,10}&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Find the highest and lowest values. 10 is the highest value and 1 is the lowest value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Subtract the lowest value from the highest value to calculate the range. 10 &minus; 1 = 9&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Answer For the data set x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9,10,10}, the range is 9.</p>
