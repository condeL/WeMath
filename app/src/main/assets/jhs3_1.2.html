<h2>3.2 Angles&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Angles of regular polygons We have a formula to calculate the size of the interior angle of a regular polygon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A ̂ = (n - 2 )/n &times; 180◦&nbsp;</p>
<p>where n is the number of sides and A&circ; is any angle. Areas of Polygons Area of triangle: 1 2&times; base &times; perpendicular height Area of trapezium: 1 2&times; (sum of k sides) &times; perpendicular height Area of parallelogram and rhombus: base &times; perpendicular height Area of rectangle: length &times; breadth Area of square: length of side &times; length of side.</p>
<p><strong>Parallelograms&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To show that a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, show any one of the first four properties or that one pair of opposite sides are equal and parallel. Theorem 1: Given a parallelogram ABCD (with both pairs of opposite sides parallel), prove that the opposite sides and angles are equal. (figure 4 here) Proof: Join AC. In 4ABC and 4ADC: 1.&nbsp;&ang;DAC =&nbsp;&ang;ACB alternate angles =, AD k BC 2.&nbsp;&ang;BAC =&nbsp;&ang;ACD alternate angles =, AB k CD 3. AC = AC common sides So 4ABC &equiv; 4CDA (AAS) So AB = CD and DA = BC corresponding sides in congruent triangles B&circ; = D&circ;, A&circ; = C&circ; corresponding angles in congruent triangles Hence opposite sides equal and opposite angles equal. Theorem 2: Given parallelogram ABCD with AC and BD joined and denote their intersection by O. Prove that AC and BD bisect each other. (figure 5 here) Proof: In 4AOB and 4COD: 1.&nbsp;&ang;BAC =&nbsp;&ang;ACD alternate angles =, AB k CD 2.&nbsp;&ang;ABD =&nbsp;&ang;BDC alternate angles =, AB k CD 3. AB = CD opposite sides of parm equal So 4ABO &equiv; 4CDO (AAS) So AO = OC, BO = OD corresponding sides in congruent triangles Hence AC and BD bisect each other.</p>
<p><strong>Rectangles&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To prove that a quadrilateral is a rectangle you can first prove that it is a parallelogram and then prove that it has a right-angle. Or you can directly prove that it has four right-angles. Theorem: Given rectangle ABCD prove that diagonals are equal in length. (figure 6 here) Proof: In 4ACD and 4BCD: 1. AD = BC opposite sides equal 2. DC = DC common sides are equal 3.&nbsp;&ang;D =&nbsp;&ang;C all angles equal So 4ADC&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;4BCD (RHS) So AC = BD corresponding sides in congruent triangles Hence diagonals are equal in length.&nbsp;JHS 3</p>
<p>Rhombuses&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prove that a quadrilateral is a rhombus you can first prove that it is a parallelogram. Then you can prove: all four sides equal, diagonals intersect at right-angles or diagonals bisect corner angles. Theorem: Given rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at point O. Prove that the diagonals intersect at right-angles and that they bisect the corner angles. (figure 7 here) Proof: In 4AOB and 4AOD: 1. AB = AD all sides of rhombus equal 2. AO = AO common sides are equal 3. OB = OD bisect each other So 4AOB &equiv; 4AOD (SSS) So&nbsp;&ang;AOB =&nbsp;&ang;AOD corresponding angles in congruent triangles But BD is a straight line So&nbsp;&ang;AOB =&nbsp;&ang;AOD = 90◦&nbsp;sum of angles is 180◦ So AC and BD intersect therefore diagonals intersect Now&nbsp;&ang;BAO =&nbsp;&ang;DAO corresponding angles in congruent triangles Similarly, 4AOB &equiv; 4COB&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&ang;ABO =&nbsp;&ang;CBO 4COD&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;4AOD&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&ang;CDO =&nbsp;&ang;ADO 4BOC&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;4DOC&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&ang;BCO =&nbsp;&ang;DCO Hence diagonals also bisect the corner angles.</p>
<p>Squares&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prove that a quadrilateral is a square you can prove that it is a rhombus and then prove that it has four right-angles or equal diagonals. You can also prove that it is a rectangle and then prove all four sides equal, diagonals intersect at right-angles or diagonals bisect corner angles.</p>
