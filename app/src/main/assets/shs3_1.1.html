<h2>1.0 Logarithms</h2>
<p>In mathematics many ideas are related. We saw that addition and subtraction are related and that multiplication and division are related. Similarly, exponentials and logarithms are related. Logarithms, commonly referred to as logs, are the inverse of exponentials. The logarithm of a number x in the base a is defined as the number n such that a n = x. So, if a n = x, then:</p>
<p>loga (x) = n <br /></p>
<p>Extension: Inverse Function When we say &ldquo;inverse function&rdquo; we mean that the answer becomes the question and the question becomes the answer. For example, in the equation a b = x the &ldquo;question&rdquo; is &ldquo;what is a raised to the power b.&rdquo; The answer is &ldquo;x.&rdquo; The inverse function would be or &ldquo;by what power must we raise a to obtain x.&rdquo; The answer is &ldquo;b.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mathematical symbol for logarithm is and it is read &ldquo;log to the base a of x&rdquo;. For example, is &ldquo;log to the base 10 of 100&rdquo;.</p>
