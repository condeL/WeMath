<h3>1.5 Power set&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Given a set S, the power set of S is the set that contains all subsets of S. The power set of S is usually denoted 2S or P(S). If S is a finite set with n(S) = k elements, then the power set of S contains P S () 2&nbsp;=&nbsp;k elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power sets are larger than the sets associated with them. Example 1.8 If S is the set {x, y, z}, then the complete list of subsets of S is as follows: (i) { } (also denoted&nbsp;&AElig;, the empty set), (ii) {x}, (iii) {y}, (iv) {z}, (v) {x, y}, (vi) {x, z}, (vii) {y, z}, (viii) {x, y, z}.</p>
<p>Hence the power set of S is P(S) = {{}, {x}, {y}, {z}, {x, y}, {x, z}, {y, z}, {x, y, z}}. The number of elements in P(S), n(P(S)), is 3 2 = 8.</p>
<h4>Definitions&nbsp;</h4>
<p>1. When the elements of a set are arranged in increasing order of magnitude, the first element (the least member) is called the lower limit whilst the last element (the greatest member) is the upper limit. Example: If A = {2, 4, 6, 8}, then the Lower Limit = 2 and the Upper Limit = 8&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. A set is said to be finite if it has both lower and upper limits. In other words, a set is finite if the first and the last members can be found. A finite set is also called a bounded set. For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6, 8} is a finite set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. A set without a lower or upper limit or both is called an infinite set. An infinite set is also called an unbounded set. For example, the sets N = {1, 2, 3, 4&hellip;.}, Z = {&hellip;,&ndash;3, &ndash;2, &ndash;1, 0, 1, 2, 3,&hellip;} and P = {&hellip;,7, 9, 13, 15} are infinite sets.</p>
