<h3>1.2 Adding and Subtracting</h3>
<p>Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing are the most basic operations between numbers but they are very closely related to each other. You can think of subtracting as being the opposite of adding since adding a number and then subtracting the same number will not change what you started with. For example, if we start with &lsquo;a&rsquo; and add &lsquo;b&rsquo;, then subtract &lsquo;b&rsquo;, we will just get back to &lsquo;a&rsquo; again</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">a + b &minus; b = a&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">5 + 2 &minus; 2 = 5</p>
<p >Subtraction is actually the same as adding a negative number. A negative number is a number less than zero. Numbers greater than zero are called positive numbers. In this example, a and b are positive numbers, but &minus;b is a negative number&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>a &minus; b = a + (&minus;b)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>5 &minus; 3 = 5 + (&minus;3)</em></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which order you write additions and subtractions, but it looks better to write subtractions to the right. You will agree that a &minus; b looks neater than &minus;b + a, and it makes some sums easier, for example, most people find 12 &minus; 3 a lot easier to work out than &minus;3 + 12, even though they are the same thing.
