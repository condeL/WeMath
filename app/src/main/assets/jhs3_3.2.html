<h3>2.2 Methods of Data Collection</h3>
<p>&nbsp;The method of collecting the data must be appropriate to the question being asked. Some examples of data collecting methods are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Questionnaires, surveys and interviews&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Experiments&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Other sources (friends, family, newspapers, books, magazines and the Internet) The most important aspect of each method of data collecting is to clearly formulate the question that is to be answered. The details of the data collection should therefore be structured to take your question into account.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Samples and Populations&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Before the data collecting starts, an important point to decide upon, is how much data is needed to make sure that the results give an accurate reflection to the answers that are required for the study. Ideally, the study should be designed to maximize the amount of information collected while minimizing the effort. The concepts of populations and samples is vital to minimizing effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following terms should be familiar:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Population describes the entire group under consideration in a study. For example, if you wanted to know how many learners in your school got the flu each winter, then your population would be all the learners in your school.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Sample describes a group chosen to represent the population under consideration in a study. For example, for the survey on winter flu, you might select a sample of learners, maybe one from each class.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Random sample describes a sample chosen from a population in such a way that each member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing a representative sample is crucial to obtaining results that are unbiased. For example, if we wanted to determine whether peer pressure affects the decision to start smoking, then the results would be different if only boys were interviewed, compared to if only girls were interviewed, compared to both boys and girls being interviewed. Therefore, questions like:&rdquo; How many interviews are needed?&rdquo; and&rdquo; How do I select the subjects for the interviews?&rdquo; must be asked during the design stage of the interview process. The most accurate results are obtained if the entire population is sampled for the survey, but this is expensive and time-consuming. The next best method is to randomly select a sample of subjects for the interviews. This means that whatever the method used to select subjects for the interviews, each subject has an equal chance of being selected. There are various methods of doing this but all start with a complete list of each member of the population. Then names can be picked out of a hat or can be selected by using a random number generator. Most modern scientific calculators have a random number generator or you can find one on a spreadsheet program on a computer. If the subjects for the interviews, are randomly selected then it does not matter too much how many interviews are conducted. So, if you had a total population of 1 000 learners in your school and you randomly selected 100, then that would be the sample that is used to conduct your survey.</p>
