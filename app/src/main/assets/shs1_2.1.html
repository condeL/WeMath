<h3>2.2 Recurrent decimal fractions&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Recurrent decimals are repeated decimals. It can be seen that every recurrent decimal represents a rational number. Every rational number can be represented by a terminal decimal or a recurrent decimal. If the denominator of a rational number (written in simplest form) has prime factors other than 2 and 5, then the rational number is recognized as a recurrent decimal.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>5/8 = 0.555 555...&nbsp;OR 0.5&nbsp;&nbsp;= 2/11&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.181818 ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example 2.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>Express 0.23 in the form&nbsp;&nbsp;, where a and b are integers with no common factors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let x = 0.23&nbsp;</p>
<p>x = 0.23 23 23 &hellip;&hellip; (1)&nbsp;</p>
<p>100x = 23.23 23 23 &hellip;.. (2)&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) &ndash; (1) 99x = 23&nbsp;&THORN;&nbsp;x = 99 23</p>
