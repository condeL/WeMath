<h2>2.0 Real Number System</h2>
<p>In Junior High School, you studied about natural numbers, whole numbers and integers. Natural numbers were defined as the basic set of numbers. The set of natural numbers is N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &hellip;}. This set is also called the set of counting numbers. If we add zero to this set, we obtain the set W = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &hellip;}. This set is called the set of whole numbers. It follows that N&nbsp;&Igrave;&nbsp;W, and so N&nbsp;&Ccedil;&nbsp;W = N and N&nbsp;&Egrave;&nbsp;W = W. Any number (negative or positive) without a fraction is called an integer. The set {&hellip; &ndash;4, &ndash;3, &ndash;2, &ndash;1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 &hellip;} of integers is denoted by Z. Notice that W&nbsp;&Igrave;&nbsp;Z.</p>
<h3>2.1 Rational and irrational numbers&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>Rational numbers&nbsp;</h4>
<p>At the Junior High School level, you learnt that a rational number is any number that can be expressed as a quotient (fraction) of two integers. If r is a rational number, then there are two integers a and b such that r =&nbsp;, b&nbsp;&sup1;&nbsp;0. Rational numbers are recognized to be fractions. The numbers 2/3 , 5/7 and 8/5 are examples of rational numbers. Integers can be recognized as rational numbers since every integer can be expressed as a quotient of two numbers. However not every rational number can be said to be an integer. It therefore follows that the set Z of integers is a subset of the set Q of rational numbers (i.e. Z&nbsp;&Igrave;&nbsp;Q).</p>
<p>Types of fraction&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proper Fraction: In a proper fraction the numerator is less than the denominator, as in, 2/3, 1/2 ,etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Improper Fraction: In an improper fraction the numerator is greater than the denominator, as in, 35/8 , 52/3 etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixed Fraction: A mixed fraction contains both a whole number and a fractional part, as in, 3<sub>3/2</sub>, 4<sub>3/2</sub>, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Fraction: Like fractions are fractions with a common denominator. For example, 2/7, 3/7 are like fractions.</p>
<p>Unlike Fraction: Unlike fractions have different denominators. For example, 2/3, 3/7 are unlike fractions.</p>
