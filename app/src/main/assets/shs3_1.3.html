<h3>1.3 Laws of Logarithms&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Just as for the exponents, logarithms have some laws which make working with them easier. These laws are based on the exponential laws and are summarized first and then explained in detail.</p>
<p>loga (1) = 0&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;loga (a) = 1&nbsp;</p>
<p>loga (x &middot; y) = loga (x) + loga (y)</p>
<p>loga (x/y) = loga (x) - loga (y)</p>
<p>loga (xb ) = b loga (x)</p>
<p>loga &radic;b x = (loga (x))/b</p>
<br>

<h4>Logarithm Law 2: (a) = 1</h4>
<p>Since</p>
<p>a<sup>1</sup> = a Then,</p>
<p>by definition of logarithm in Equation log<sub>a</sub> (a) = 1</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>log<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>2 = 1</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>log<sub>25</sub> 25 = 1</p>
