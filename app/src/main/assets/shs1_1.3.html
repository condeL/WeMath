<h3>1.3 Subsets&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Consider the following example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example 1.5&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) If all Ghanaians are Africans, then {Ghanaians} is a subset of {Africans}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) All prime numbers are whole numbers; therefore {prime numbers} is a subset of {whole numbers}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The symbol&nbsp;&Igrave;&nbsp;is used to denote the phrase &lsquo;subset of&rsquo;. P is a subset of Q is therefore written as P&nbsp;&Igrave;&nbsp;Q. For example, If P = {2, 5, 8} and Q = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}, then P&nbsp;&Igrave;&nbsp;Q. If the set A is not a subset of the set B, we write A&nbsp;&Euml;&nbsp;B. It is important not to confuse the symbols&nbsp;&Igrave;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&Icirc;. The symbol&nbsp;&Igrave;&nbsp;connects two sets while&nbsp;&Icirc;&nbsp;connect a member and its set. The set of all objects under discussion is called the universe or universal set. We use the letter u or the symbol&nbsp;x&nbsp;to denote the universal set. In Example 1.5 (a) u = {Africans}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A set, which contains no elements, is called an empty (or null) set. It is usually denoted by {} or&nbsp;&AElig;. The complement of a set A is defined as the set of all elements of the universal set u, which are not elements of A. The complement of A is written as A&cent;&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {2, 4, 5} are subsets of the universal set u = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} then the complements of A and B are A&cent;&nbsp;= {2, 4, 7} and B&cent;&nbsp;= {1, 3, 7} respectively. The complement of the universal set is the empty set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A set P is said to be the subset of the set Q if all the elements of P belong to the set Q&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Example 1.6&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggest a universal set for each of the following subsets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) {Francophone countries in Africa},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) {isosceles triangles},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) {students in your class},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) {horses}.</p>
