<h3>1.4 Multiplying and Dividing&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Just like addition and subtraction, multiplication and division are opposites of each other. Multiplying by a number and then dividing by the same number gets us back to the start again:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>a &times; b &divide; b = a</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>&nbsp;5 &times; 4 &divide; 4 = 5</em></p>
<p>Sometimes you will see a multiplication of letters without the &times; symbol, don&rsquo;t worry, its exactly the same thing. Mathematicians are lazy and like to write things in the neatest way possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>abc = a &times; b &times; c</em></p>
<p>It is usually neater to write known numbers to the left, and letters to the right. So, although 4&nbsp;and&nbsp;4 are the same, it looks better to write 4. If you see a multiplication outside a bracket like this&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>a (b + c)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>3 (4 &minus; 3)</em></p>
<p>then it means you have to multiply each part inside the bracket by the number outside&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>a (b + c) = ab + ac</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>3(4 &minus; 3) = 3 &times; 4 &minus; 3 &times; 3 = 12 &minus; 9 = 3</em></p>
<p>unless you can simplify everything inside the bracket into a single term. In fact, in the above example, it would have been smarter to have done this&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>3(4 &minus; 3) = 3 &times; (1) = 3 (1.11)</em></p>
<p>It can happen with letters too:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>3(4a &minus; 3a) = 3 &times; (a) = 3a (1.12)</em></p>
<p>If there are two brackets multiplied by each other, then you can do it one step at a time</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>(a + b) (c + d) = a (c + d) + b (c + d)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> = ac + ad + bc + bd&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>(a + 3) (4 + d) = a (4 + d) + 3(4 + d)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> = 4a + ad + 12 + 3d</em></p>
