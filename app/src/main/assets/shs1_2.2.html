<h3>2.3 Percentages&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Percentages such as 60%, 45 % and 25% are recognized as rational numbers.</p>
<p>Example&nbsp;</p>
<p>60% = 60/100&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;3/5, </p>
<p>45% = 45/100&nbsp;= 9/20,&nbsp;</p>
<p>25% =&nbsp;&nbsp;25/100&nbsp;= 1/4&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Irrational numbers&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Numbers such as&nbsp;p, 2, 3, 5 etc. cannot be expressed as ratios of two integers. Such numbers are called irrational numbers. Irrational numbers have no termination and are nonrecurring. Example: 2 = 1.414 213 562 &hellip; 3 = 1.732 050 808 &hellip; 5 = 2.236 067 977 &hellip;&nbsp;p&nbsp;(pi) = 3.141 592 654 &hellip; The set of irrational numbers is denoted by Q&cent;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exercise 2.1 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which of the following is/are rational? P = {3, 5, 7}, Q =&nbsp;{19, , 25}&nbsp;7 3 , R = {-5&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&pound;&nbsp;9} 2. Sort out the following numbers into rational and irrational. (a) 5.234 234 &hellip;, (b) 2.321 435 &hellip;, (c) 7.463 127 &hellip;</p>
