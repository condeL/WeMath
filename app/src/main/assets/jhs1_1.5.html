<h3>1.5 Rearranging Equations</h3>
<p>Coming back to the example about change, which we wanted to solve earlier in equation</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>x + y = z</em></p>
<p>To recap your memory, z is the amount you (or a customer) payed for something, y is the price and you want to find x, the change. What you need to do is rearrange the equation so only x is on the left. You can add, subtract, multiply or divide both sides of an equation by any number you want, as long as you always do it to both sides. If you imagine an equation is like a set of weighing scales. (NOTE: diagram here.) If you wish to keep the scales balanced, then when you add something to one side, you must also add something of the same weight to the other side. So, for our example we could subtract y from both sides&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> </em><em>x + y = z&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> = x + y &minus; y = z &minus; y&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> x = z &minus; y</em></p>
<p>So, now we can find the change is the amount payed take away the price. In real life we can do this in our head, the human brain is very smart and can-do arithmetic without even knowing it. When you subtract a number from both sides of an equation, it looks just like you moved a positive number from one side and it became a negative on the other, which is exactly what happened. Likewise, if you move a multiplied number from one side to the other, it looks like it changed to a divide. This is because you really just divided both sides by that number, and a number divided by itself is just 1&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>a (5 + c) = 3a</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>a &divide; a (5 + c) = 3a &divide; a</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> 1 &times; (5 + c) = 3 &times; 1</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> 5 + c = 3</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> c = 3 &minus; 5 = &minus;2</em></p>
<p>However, you must be careful when doing this, as it is easy to make mistakes. The following is the wrong thing to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>5a + c = 3a&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> 5 + c 6= 3a &divide; a</em></p>
<p>Can you see why it is wrong? The reason why it is wrong is because we didn&rsquo;t divide the c part by a as well. The correct thing to do is&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>5a + c = 3a</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>5 + c &divide; a = 3</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> c &divide; a = 3 &minus; 5 = &minus;2</em></p>
<p>Living Without the Number Line The number line in is a good way to visualize what negative numbers are, but it can be inefficient to use it every time you want to add or subtract negative numbers. To keep things simple, we will write down three rules that you should memorize. These rules will let you work out what the answer is when you add or subtract numbers which may be negative and will also help you keep your work tidy and easier to understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Signs Rule 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you have an equation which has a negative number on the very far left, it can be confusing. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter where we put the negative number, as long as it is on the left of the equals sign. If we move it more to the right, it makes more sense as it just looks like subtracting a positive number.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&minus;a + b = b &minus; a&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> &minus;5 + 10 = 10 &minus; 5 = 5</p>
<p>This makes equations easier to understand. For example, a question like &ldquo;What is &minus;7+11?&rdquo; looks a lot more complicated than &ldquo;What is 11&minus;7?&rdquo;, even though they are exactly the same question.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Signs Rule 2&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When you have two negative numbers like &minus;3 &minus; 7, you can calculate the answer by simply adding together the numbers as if they were positive and then remembering to put a negative sign in front.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>&minus;c &minus; d = &minus; (c + d)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> &minus;7 &minus; 2 = &minus;(7 + 2) = &minus;9</em></p>
<p><strong>Signs Rule 3&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In section 1.1.2 we seen that the sign of two numbers added together depends on which one is bigger. This last rule tells us that all we need to do is take the smaller number away from the larger one, and remember to put a negative sign before the answer if the bigger number was subtracted to begin with. In this equation, F is bigger than e.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>e &minus; F = &minus;(F &minus; e) (1.20)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>2 &minus; 11 = &minus;(11 &minus; 2) = &minus;9</em></p>
<p>You can even combine these rules together, so for example you can use rule 1 on &minus;10 + 3 to get 3 &minus; 10, and then use rule 3 to get &minus;(10 &minus; 3) = &minus;7. Now you know everything there is to know about arithmetic. So, try out your skills on the exercises at the end of this chapter and ask your teacher for more questions just like them. You can also try making up your own questions, solve them and try them out on your classmates to see if you get the same answers. Practice is the only way to get good at math.</p>
