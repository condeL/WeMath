<h3>2.3 Types of sets&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>1. Finite and infinite set&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When the elements of a set are arranged in increasing order of magnitude, the first element (the least member) is called the <strong><em>lower limit&nbsp;</em></strong>whilst the last element (the greatest member) is the <strong><em>upper limit</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Example: If <em>A&nbsp;</em>= {2, 4, 6, 8}, then the Lower Limit = 2 and the Upper Limit = 8&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) A set is said to be <strong><em>finite&nbsp;</em></strong>if it has both lower and upper limits. In other words, a set is finite if the first and the last members can be found. A finite set is also called a <strong><em>bounded set</em></strong>. For example, the following sets are finite: (i) <em>A&nbsp;</em>= {2, 4, 6, 8}, (ii) <em>B&nbsp;</em>= {<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, &hellip;, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>}, (iii) <em>C&nbsp;</em>= {red, yellow, green, blue, black}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) A set without a lower or upper limit or both is called an <strong><em>infinite set</em></strong>. An infinite set is also called an <strong><em>unbounded set</em></strong>. For example, the following sets are infinite:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) <em>N&nbsp;</em>= {1, 2, 3, 4&hellip;}, (ii) <em>Z&nbsp;</em>= {&hellip;, &ndash;3, &ndash;2, &ndash;1, 0, 1, 2, 3&hellip;}, (iii) <em>P&nbsp;</em>= {&hellip;,7, 9, 13, 15}.</p>
<p><strong>2. Empty set&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A set, which contains no elements, is called an <strong><em>empty&nbsp;</em>(<em>or null</em>) <em>set</em></strong>. It is usually denoted by { } or ïƒ†. The following sets are empty:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) {days of the week with names beginning with the letter <em>Y</em>},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) {prime numbers greater than 8 but less than 11},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) {three sided squares}.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Unit set&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A set with only one member is called a <strong><em>unit set</em></strong>. A unit set is sometimes called a <strong><em>singleton</em></strong>. For example, <em>A&nbsp;</em>= {3} or <em>B&nbsp;</em>= {7} is a unit set.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 2.11&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Which of the following are unit sets?&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) {days of the week with names beginning with the letter <em>M</em>},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) {the football team of your school},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) {present capitals of Ghana},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) {Francophone countries in Africa}.&nbsp;</p>
