<h3>1.1 Letters and Arithmetic</span></span></h3>
<br>
<p>When you add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers, you are performing arithmetic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These four basic operations (+, −, ×, ÷) can be performed on any two real numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since they work for any two real numbers, it would take forever to write out every possible combination, since there is an infinite amount of real numbers!</p>
<p>To make things easier, it is convenient to use letters to stand in for any number, and then we can fill in a particular number when we need to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the following equation:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">x + y = z</p>
<br>
<p>In this equation, 'x' represents the amount of change you should get z.&nbsp;'z'&nbsp;is the amount you payed and 'y' is the price of the item.&nbsp</p>
<p>All you need to do is write the amount you payed instead of z and the price instead of y, your change is then x.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But to be able to find your change you will need to rearrange the equation for x.</p>
