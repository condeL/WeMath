<h3>2.2 Describing and writing Sets&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Not all sets have precise descriptions of any sort; they may simply be arbitrary collections, with no expressible "rule" saying what elements are in or out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Some sets may be <strong><em>described in words</em></strong>, for example:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A&nbsp;</em>is the set whose members are the first five positive whole numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>B&nbsp;</em>is the set whose members are the colors of the Ghanaian Flag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. A set can also be defined by explicitly <strong><em>listing its elements</em></strong>. For example,&nbsp;</p>
<p>P = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} or Q {red, yellow, green, black}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For sets with many elements, an abbreviated list is sometimes used. For example, the first one thousand positive whole numbers can be described using the symbolic shorthand: where the ellipsis (...) indicates that the list continues in the obvious way. Similarly, the set of even numbers can be described by the notation: R {1, 2, 3, ..., 1 000}, T {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Sometimes, we can describe a set using a <strong><em>set-builder notation</em></strong>. For example, the set <em>P&nbsp;</em>can also be described using a notation or symbol such as &lsquo;<em>x</em>&rsquo; to represent any member of the set of even numbers between 1 and 20. Thus we can write <em>P&nbsp;</em>as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>P&nbsp;</em>= {<em>x</em>: <em>x&nbsp;</em>is an even number, and 1 &lt; <em>x&nbsp;</em>&lt; 20}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the above expression for <em>P</em>, the colon &lsquo;:&rsquo; means &lsquo;such that&rsquo;, and is followed by the property that <em>x&nbsp;</em>is an even number between 1 and 20. The set <em>Q&nbsp;</em>of integers greater than 100 can be written as&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Q&nbsp;</em>= {<em>x&nbsp;</em>: <em>x&nbsp;</em>is an integer, and <em>x&nbsp;</em>&gt; 100}&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set <em>R&nbsp;</em>of regions in Ghana can also be written as&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>R&nbsp;</em>= {<em>x&nbsp;</em>: <em>x&nbsp;</em>is a region in Ghana}&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other letters such as <em>y&nbsp;</em>and <em>z&nbsp;</em>can also be used as notations for representing sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Some useful definitions&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The following are some few definitions that will enable us to define the elements of sets in problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. An <strong><em>integer&nbsp;</em></strong>is a positive or negative whole number. Examples are &hellip; &ndash;5, &ndash;4, &ndash;3, &ndash;2, &ndash;1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. An <strong><em>odd number&nbsp;</em></strong>is a number which cannot be divided exactly by two (2). Odd numbers can be expressed as 2n + 1, where n is an integer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: &hellip; &ndash;5, &ndash;3, &ndash;1, 1, 3, 5, &hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. An <strong><em>even number&nbsp;</em></strong>is a number leaving no remainder when divided by two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: &hellip; &ndash;6, <em>&ndash;</em>4, <em>&ndash;</em>2, 0, 2, 4, 6 &hellip;</p>
<p>4. An integer <em>x&nbsp;</em>is said to be <strong><em>a factor&nbsp;</em></strong>of another integer <em>y&nbsp;</em>if <em>x&nbsp;</em>can divide <em>y&nbsp;</em>without leaving any remainder. Example: The set factors of 48 = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48}&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. A <strong><em>prime number&nbsp;</em></strong>is any positive number that is exactly divisible only by itself&nbsp;</p>
<p>and one. Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. The <strong><em>prime factors&nbsp;</em></strong>of a number <em>n&nbsp;</em>refer to the factors of <em>n&nbsp;</em>that are prime numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: The set of prime factors of 36 = {2, 3}&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. <strong><em>Multiple of a number&nbsp;</em></strong><em>x&nbsp;</em>refers to any number formed when <em>x&nbsp;</em>is multiplied by any integer. Example: Multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Example&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>List the elements of the following sets:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) <em>P&nbsp;</em>is the set of months of the year with names beginning with the letter <em>J</em>,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) <em>Q&nbsp;</em>is the set of vowels of the English alphabets,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) <em>R&nbsp;</em>is the set of first six positive integers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) <em>S&nbsp;</em>is the set of consecutive even numbers greater than 4 but less than 12.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>(a) <em>P&nbsp;</em>= {January, June, July}, (b) <em>Q&nbsp;</em>= {<em>a</em>, <em>e</em>, <em>i</em>, <em>o</em>, <em>u</em>},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) <em>R&nbsp;</em>= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, (d) <em>S&nbsp;</em>= {6, 8, 10}.&nbsp;</p>
