<h3>1.2 Set-builder notation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We can describe a set by using some of the above definitions or properties. For example, the set P of even numbers between 1 and 20 can be written in the following two ways (1) P = {even numbers between 1 and 20} (2) P = {2, 4, 6, &hellip;, 18}&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set P can also be described using a notation or symbol such as &lsquo;x&rsquo; to represent any member of the set of even numbers between 1 and 20. Thus we can write P as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>P = {x: x is an even number, and 1 &lt; x &lt; 20} In the above expression for P, the colon &lsquo;:&rsquo; means &lsquo;such that&rsquo;, and is followed by the property that x is an even number between 1 and 20. The set Q of integers greater than 100 can be written as&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q = {x: x is an integer, and x &gt; 100} The set R of regions in Ghana can also be written as&nbsp;</p>
<p>R = {x: x is a region in Ghana} Other letters such as y and z can also be used as notations for representing sets.</p>
<p>Example 1.2&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use set builder notation to describe the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) The set of odd numbers greater than 30,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) The set of prime numbers greater than 2 but less than 24,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) The set of triangles,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) The set of positive integers less than 100,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e) The set of rivers in Ghana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) {x: x is an odd number, and x &gt; 30}&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) {x: x is a prime number, and 2 &lt; x &lt; 24}&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) {x: x is a triangle}&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) {x: x is a positive integer, x &lt; 100}&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e) {x: x is a river in Ghana}&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example 1.3 List the elements of the following sets</p>
<p>(a) A = {x: x is a factor of 12},&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) B = {x: x is a multiple of 4 less than 20}</p>
<p>Solution&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) A = {x: x is a factor of 12} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) B = {x: x is a multiple of 4 less than 20} = {4, 8, 12, 16}</p>
