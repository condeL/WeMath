<h2> Operations in the correct order</h2></br>

<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp2bYWRQylk">Visit our HTML tutorial</a></h3>

<p>When you are faced with a mathematical expression that has several operations or parentheses, the solution may be affected by the order in which you tackle the operations. For example, take the expression
    <br><br>
    4⋅7−2
    <br><br>
    If we do the multiplication first, we arrive at the following answer:
    <br><br>
    28−2=26
    <br><br>
    If instead we begin by substracting, we get:
    <br><br>
    4⋅5=20
    <br><br>
    In order to avoid confusion and to ensure that everyone always arrives at the same result, mathematicians established a standard order of operations for calculations that involve more than one arithmetic operation. Arithmetic operations should always be carried out in the following order:
    <br><br>
    Simplify the expressions inside parentheses ( ), brackets [ ], braces { } and fractions bars.<br>
    Evaluate all powers.<br><br>
    Do all multiplications and divisions from left to right.<br><br>
    Do all additions and subtractions from left to right.<br><br>
    Example:
    <br><br>
    Suppose you want to figure out how many hours a person works in two days assuming that they work 4 hours before lunch and 3 hours after lunch each day. First, work out how many hours the person works each day:
    <br><br>
    4+3=7
    <br><br>
    and then multiply that by the number of days the person worked:<br><br>

    7⋅2=14 <br><br>
    If we were to write this example as one expression, we would need to use parentheses to make sure that people calculate the addition first: <br><br>

    (4+3)⋅2=14</p>
