<h3>2.2 General Equation for the nth-term of an Arithmetic Sequence&nbsp;</h3>
<p>More formally, the number we start out with is called a1 (the first term), and the difference between each successive term is denoted d, called the common difference. The general arithmetic sequence looks like:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a<sub>1</sub> = a<sub>1</sub></p>
<p>a<sub>2</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + d</p>
<p>a<sub>3</sub> = a<sub>2</sub> + d = (a<sub>1</sub> + d) + d = a<sub>1</sub> + 2d</p>
<p>a<sub>4</sub> = a<sub>3</sub>+ d = (a<sub>1</sub> + 2d) + d = a<sub>1</sub> + 3d</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1&nbsp;</sub> + d &middot; (n - 1)</p>
<p>Thus, the equation for the nth-term will be:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a<sub>n&nbsp;</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + d &middot; (n - 1)</p>
<p>Given a_1 and the common difference, d, the entire set of numbers belonging to an arithmetic sequence can be generated.</p>
<p>Definition:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arithmetic Sequence An arithmetic (or linear) sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each new term is calculated by adding a constant value to the previous term:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>(n-1)</sub> + d</p>
<p>where&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; a<sub>n</sub> represents the new term, the n th-term, that is calculated;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; a<sub>(n-1) </sub>represents the previous term, the (n - 1)th-term;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; d represents some constant.</p>
