<h3>1.1 Introduction&nbsp;</h3>
<p>If you want to prepare a cake, you need flour, eggs, margarine, baking powder and sugar. When you buy these ingredients in a shop, you probably do not buy them one at a time. It is easier and cheaper to buy them in a set. We often use the word &lsquo;set&rsquo; to describe a collection of objects, quantities or numbers. We have a set of living room furniture: what does it contain? We speak of cutlery set, a math set, the set of students under 14 in your class and so on. Can you think of anymore? A set is usually denoted by capital letters such as A, B, P, Q, X and Y. The objects that make up a set are called members or elements of the set. The elements of a set may be named in a list or may be given by a description enclosed in braces {}. For instance, the set of numbers between 1 and 6 may be given as {2,3,4,5} or as {the numbers between 1 and 6}. For example, in the set Q = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, 4 is a member or element of the set Q. In set operations, the symbol&nbsp;&Icirc;&nbsp;is used to denote the phrase &lsquo;is a member of&rsquo; or &lsquo;is an element of&rsquo; or &lsquo;belongs to&rsquo;. So, the statement &lsquo;4 is a member of Q&rsquo; can be written as 4&nbsp;&Icirc;&nbsp;Q. Can you name the other elements of the set Q? Similarly, the statement &lsquo;5 is not a member of Q&rsquo; may be abbreviated to 5&Iuml;Q,&nbsp;&Iuml;&nbsp;standing for &lsquo;is not an element of&rsquo; or &lsquo;does not belong to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A set is a collection or list of objects, quantities or numbers with specified properties.</p>
<p>Example 1.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>If P = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and Q = {3, 5, 7, 9}, complete the following statements by inserting&nbsp;&Icirc;,&nbsp;&Iuml;, P, Q or elements of the sets P and Q (a) 4 &hellip; P (b) 6&nbsp;&Icirc;&nbsp;&hellip; (c) 2&nbsp;&Iuml;&nbsp;&hellip; (d) 8 &hellip; Q (e) &hellip;&nbsp;&Iuml;&nbsp;P (f) 10 &hellip; Q (g) 5&nbsp;&Icirc;&nbsp;&hellip; (h) 7&nbsp;&Iuml;&nbsp;&hellip; (i) 7 &hellip; P (j) &hellip;&nbsp;&Iuml;&nbsp;Q.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are some few definitions that will enable us to define the elements of sets in problems.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li>An odd number is a number which when divided by two (2) leaves a remainder of one (1). Example: &hellip; &ndash;5, &ndash;3, &ndash;1, 1, 3, 5 &hellip;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>An even number is a number which leaves no remainder when it is divided by two (2). Example: &hellip; &ndash;6, &ndash;4, &ndash;2, 0, 2, 4, 6 &hellip;</li>
    <li>An integer x is said to be a factor of another integer y if x can divide y without leaving any remainder. Example: The set factors of 48 = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48}&nbsp;</li>
    <li>A prime number is any positive number that is exactly divisible only by itself and one. Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The prime factors of a number n refer to the factors of n that are prime numbers. Example: The set of prime factors of 36 = {2, 3} 6. Multiple of a number x refers to any number formed when x is multiplied by any integer. Example: Multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, etc.</li>
