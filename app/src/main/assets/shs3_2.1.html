<h2>2. Sequences and Series</h2>
<h3>2.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>In this chapter we extend the arithmetic and quadratic sequences studied in earlier grades, to geometric sequences. We also look at series, which is the summing of the terms in a sequence.</p>
<p>2.2 Arithmetic Sequences The simplest type of numerical sequence is an arithmetic sequence.</p>
<p>Definition: Arithmetic Sequence An arithmetic (or linear) sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each new term is calculated by adding a constant value to the previous term</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>1,2,3,4,5,6, . . .</p>
<p>is an arithmetic sequence because you add 1 to the current term to get the next term:</p>
<p>first term:</p>
<p>second term:</p>
<p>third term: </p>

<p>nth term:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Activity :: Common Difference :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find the constant value that is added to get the following sequences and write out the next 5 terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. 2,6,10,14,18,22,...&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. -5,- 3,- 1,1,3,...&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. 1,4,7,10,13,16,...&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. -1,10,21,32,43,54,...&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. 3,0,- 3,- 6,- 9,- 12,...</p>
